# NoSQL-Social-Network-API [![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)]
 
  ## Description

  In this Challenge, we built an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create a friend list. We used Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database and the Mongoose ODM.

  I used Day.js for the date and timestamps.
